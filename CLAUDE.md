## Architecture Overview

### Core Components Architecture

Containerd follows a **layered plugin architecture** with these key layers:

1. **Client Layer** (`client/`): High-level APIs for container operations
2. **Core Services** (`core/`): Service interfaces (content, snapshots, runtime, containers, images)
3. **Plugin Layer** (`plugins/`): Service implementations and extensions
4. **API Layer** (`api/`): gRPC/TTRPC protocol definitions
5. **Runtime Layer** (`core/runtime/`): Container lifecycle management

### Plugin System Patterns

All plugins follow this registration pattern:
```go
func init() {
    registry.Register(&plugin.Registration{
        Type: plugins.PluginType,
        ID:   "plugin-id",
        Requires: []plugin.Type{plugins.DependencyPlugin},
        InitFn: func(ic *plugin.InitContext) (interface{}, error) {
            // Plugin initialization
            return implementation, nil
        },
    })
}
```

### Key Service Interfaces

- **Content Service** (`core/content/`): Content-addressable storage with Provider/Ingester/Manager interfaces
- **Snapshots Service** (`core/snapshots/`): Layered filesystem management with Snapshotter interface
- **Container Service** (`core/containers/`): Container metadata management with Store interface
- **Runtime Service** (`core/runtime/`): Task creation and process lifecycle management
- **Image Service** (`core/images/`): Image metadata and manipulation
- **Transfer Service** (`core/transfer/`): Image pull/push operations with registry integration

### Critical Operation Flows

**Image Pull**: Client ‚Üí Transfer service ‚Üí Remote resolver ‚Üí Content store ‚Üí Image store ‚Üí Snapshotter

**Container Creation**: Client ‚Üí Container store ‚Üí Snapshotter (prepare layer) ‚Üí Runtime plugin

**Task Execution**: Container ‚Üí Runtime plugin ‚Üí Shim process ‚Üí Runtime (runc) ‚Üí Event system

### Directory Structure

- `/cmd/`: Main binaries (`containerd`, `ctr`, `containerd-shim-runc-v2`)
- `/core/`: Core service interfaces and implementations
- `/plugins/`: Plugin implementations (content, snapshots, services, CRI)
- `/client/`: Client library and high-level APIs
- `/api/`: Protocol buffer definitions for services and types
- `/internal/`: Internal utilities and helpers (not for external use)
- `/pkg/`: Reusable packages for external consumption

### Key Files for Plugin Development

- `plugins/types.go`: Plugin type definitions
- `plugins/*/plugin.go`: Plugin registration and initialization
- `core/*/interface.go`: Core service interfaces
- `cmd/containerd/builtins/`: Built-in plugin registrations

### Build Tags

Common build tags to be aware of:
- `no_cri`: Disable CRI plugin
- `no_btrfs`: Disable Btrfs snapshotter
- `no_devmapper`: Disable device mapper snapshotter
- `no_zfs`: Disable ZFS snapshotter
- `no_systemd`: Disable systemd integration

### Development Guidelines

- Follow standard Go formatting (`make check` enforces this)
- Use tabs for protobuf file indentation
- Generate protobuf files with `make protos` after changes
- Plugin implementations should be in `/plugins/` directory
- Core interfaces should be in `/core/` directory
- Use the plugin registry pattern for extensibility
- Event-driven architecture for state changes and monitoring

### Testing Guidelines

- Unit tests should not require root privileges unless testing root-specific functionality
- Integration tests should use the `/integration/` directory
- CRI-specific tests are in `/plugins/cri/` and run with `make cri-integration`
- Use `testutil.RequiresRoot` for tests requiring root privileges
- Test containers and cleanup are handled by the test framework

## Current Branch Context: `short-path-fix`

This branch focuses on optimizing shared snapshots and path mapping for containerd. Recent changes include:

### ‚úÖ Completed Features:

1. **Shared Storage Support**: Enhanced the overlay snapshotter to allocate upperdir on shared storage while keeping lowerdir on local filesystems for containers matching specific conditions defined in /etc/containerd/config.toml file.

2. **Hash-based Path Optimization**: Implemented hash-based directory paths to significantly reduce mount option lengths:
   - Pod identifiers are hashed to create short directory names (8 characters)
   - Snapshot IDs are hashed for unique path generation
   - Maintains path uniqueness while drastically reducing length
   - Successfully tested with containers having 50+ layers

3. **Path Mapping System**: Created a comprehensive path mapping system (`path_mapping.go`) that:
   - Maps hash-based paths back to original Kubernetes identifiers
   - Persists mappings to JSON files for debugging and recovery
   - Provides lookup functionality for troubleshooting
   - Verified working: Path mappings correctly stored in `/s/.path-mappings.json`

4. **Short Path Structure**: Uses `/s/l/` for snapshot paths instead of long containerd paths:
   - Short paths: `/s/l/143/fs` instead of `/s/d/io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.overlayfs/snapshots/143/fs`
   - Shared storage: `/s/{pod_hash}/{snapshot_hash}/fs` for container state

5. **Robust Parent Path Resolution**: Handles transitions between path configurations:
   - Tries current path method first, then fallback to opposite method
   - Handles existing snapshots during configuration changes

6. **Configuration Support**: Added plugin configuration options:
   - `short_base_paths` configuration flag
   - Integration with existing overlay plugin architecture
   - Backward compatibility with existing configurations

### üîß Technical Implementation:

- **Files Modified**: `plugins/snapshots/overlay/overlay.go`, `plugins/snapshots/overlay/plugin/plugin.go`
- **Files Added**: `plugins/snapshots/overlay/path_mapping.go`
- **Key Functions**: `getSharedPathBase()`, `hashString()`, `determineUpperPath()`, `determineWorkPath()`
- **Path Strategy**: Uses hash-based short directory names and proper shared storage base calculation

### üõ°Ô∏è Critical Safeguards:

The implementation includes several critical safeguards to prevent accidental data loss:

1. **Short Paths Protection**: The `/s/l` directory containing layer snapshots is protected from accidental deletion during cleanup operations
2. **Path Conflict Detection**: Prevents conflicts between shared storage paths and containerd's internal structure
3. **Migration Safety**: Graceful handling of transitions between path configurations with fallback mechanisms
4. **Atomic Operations**: Uses atomic moves and temporary files for critical filesystem operations

### üìã Configuration Example:

To enable short base paths, add the following to your containerd configuration:

```toml
[plugins."io.containerd.snapshotter.v1.overlayfs"]
  short_base_paths = true
```

For shared storage snapshots, containers must be labeled with:
```toml
labels = [
  "containerd.io/snapshot/use-shared-storage=true",
  "containerd.io/snapshot/shared-disk-path=/shared/storage/path",
  "containerd.io/snapshot/k8s-namespace=default",
  "containerd.io/snapshot/k8s-pod-name=my-pod",
  "containerd.io/snapshot/k8s-container-name=my-container"
]
```

## Session Restore Functionality

### Rust Session Restore Tool

The repository includes a Rust-based session restore tool (`src/main.rs`) that enables containers to restore their previous state when resuming from shared storage snapshots. This tool is particularly useful for notebook environments where users need to resume their work from a previous session.

Key features of the session restore tool:
1. **Path Mapping Integration**: Reads the path mappings JSON file to identify previous sessions
2. **Session Discovery**: Finds available sessions on shared storage based on pod hash
3. **Content Restoration**: Copies files from previous sessions to restore container state
4. **Cleanup Operations**: Removes old sessions to manage storage space

### Wrapper and Hook Scripts

- `session-restore-wrapper.sh`: A shell wrapper that provides logging and error handling for the Rust binary
- `session-restore-hook.sh`: A post-start hook script that can be used in Kubernetes environments

### Usage Example

The tool is typically invoked through a Kubernetes lifecycle hook as shown in `test/test-shared-snapshot-pod.teco.yaml`. The postStart hook executes the wrapper script with parameters identifying the current pod and container.

Example invocation:
```bash
/etc/scripts/session-restore-wrapper.sh \
  --mappings-file /etc/path-mappings.json \
  --namespace default \
  --pod-name nb-test-teco-0 \
  --container-name inference
```

This functionality enables stateful applications to resume from previous sessions when using shared storage snapshots, providing a seamless user experience in notebook environments.
